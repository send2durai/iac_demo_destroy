# iac_destroy_demo

This repo is to use us to destory the services in AWS Cloud. The code is written in HCL, hence terraform will destroy the resources.

Note, this job is to be a 'This project is parameterized' with 'Choice Parameter' set. Also, GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling is enabled. The moment, when there is a commit against this project kicks in.
